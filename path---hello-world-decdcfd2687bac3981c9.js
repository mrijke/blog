There have been many times already that I’ve been stuck on something for so long, that afterwards I thought to myself… <em>“I could probably write a blog post about this”.</em></p>\n<p>So, here we are. And I wouldn’t be me if this thing wasn’t completely over-engineered and over-the-top complicated. This blog is made with <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS</a>, a static site generator for React. It allows you to write your blogposts in plain Markdown, and then does a lot of black magic (spoilers: it’s <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>) so that your post data is query-able from React components, which you then use to build the actual site itself.</p>\n<p>I know, a lot of moving parts just for a bunch of text. But hey, without over-engineering we’d still be stuck with PHP - and no one wants that. At least now I can get some real-world hands-on experience with GraphQL and see for myself what all the cool kids are talking about. Gotta stay on board the hype train - hype driven development is in full effect.</p>\n<p>For the curious - the full source of this blog is available on <a href="https://github.com/mrijke/blog/">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Regarding content on this blog - I’ll be primarily posting about frontend thingies, in particular TypeScript &#x26; React. Perhaps occasionally there will be a backend post - either on Django Rest Framework or Django itself. Or something sysadmin/devops related - I like to tinker around in that area too.</p>\n<p>Enjoy reading!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Hello world!",date:"March 23, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hello-world/",previous:!1,next:{fields:{slug:"/redux-saga-upload-progress/"},frontmatter:{title:"Tracking file upload progress with redux-saga event channels & superagent"}}}}}});
