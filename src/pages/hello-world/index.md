I finally caved in and created a blog. There have been many times already that I've been stuck on something for so long, that afterwards I thought to myself... _"I could probably write a blog post about this"._

So, here we are. And I wouldn't be me if this thing wasn't completely over-engineered and over-the-top complicated. This blog is made with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org), a static site generator for React. It allows you to write your blogposts in plain Markdown, and then does a lot of black magic (spoilers: it's [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)) so that your post data is query-able from React components, which you then use to build the actual site itself.

I know, a lot of moving parts just for a bunch of text. But hey, without over-engineering we'd still be stuck with PHP - and no one wants that. At least now I can get some real-world hands-on experience with GraphQL and see for myself what all the cool kids are talking about. Gotta stay on board the hype train - hype driven development is in full effect.

For the curious - the full source of this blog is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrijke/blog/).

Regarding content on this blog - I'll be primarily posting about frontend thingies, in particular TypeScript & React. Perhaps occasionally there will be a backend post - either on Django Rest Framework or Django itself. Or something sysadmin/devops related - I like to tinker around in that area too.

Enjoy reading!
